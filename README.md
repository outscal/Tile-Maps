You are given a scene with all the required assets with a readymade scene.

You will find the instructional course for this project in this github repo below, please click the url:

[Github Course Repository](https://github.com/outscal/Tile-Maps-Instructions.git)

Use the course to think of the requirements for implementing the Dash feature in this readymade. Then you can create a new scene copying the existing one and try the implementation.

The Solution is provided in the Solution-Statement branch of this repository. I suggest you to try for the solution yourself first, then you can take a look at the solution.

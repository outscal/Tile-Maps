# Tile Maps

This is a fun 2D project that shows how the latest tool in unity called Tile Maps can be used. Essentially, this allows to create your levels quickly using Tile Maps and Tile Map Editor.

First open the Problem-Statement branch from the branch dropdown of this repository. Use the assets and the corresponding course to design the solution on your own.

The solution is provided in the Solution-Statement branch, I would strongly suggest you to make the solution yourself first.

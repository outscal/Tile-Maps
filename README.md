# Tile Maps

This is a fun 2D project that shows how the latest tool in unity called Tile Maps can be used. Essentially, this allows to create your levels quickly using Tile Maps and Tile Map Editor.

First open the Problem-Statement branch from the branch dropdown of this repository. Use the assets and the corresponding course to design the solution on your own.

The solution is provided in the Solution-Statement branch, I would strongly suggest you to make the solution yourself first.


# Problem Statement

You are given a scene with all the required assets for creating TileMaps. Try to make 3 different levels with a variety of Tile sets to make each level look unique.

You will find the instructional course for this project in this github repo below, please click the url:

Use the course to think of the requirements for implementing the Dash feature in this readymade. Then you can create a new scene copying the existing one and try the implementation.

The Solution is provided in the Solution-Statement branch of this repository. I suggest you to try for the solution yourself first, then you can take a look at the solution.
